    <h1>Brief history of Aya_Creme</h1>
    <p>In Nigeria, Tigernuts are known by the Hausa people as Aya; known by the Igbos as Akis; while the Yoruba people
      call it
      Ofio.
    </p>

    <p>The date fruits are referred to as Debino by the Hausa folks; known as Mkpuru Ubochi by the Igbos; while the
      Yoruba
      people call it Eso Eso.
    </p>

    <p>The Coconut is called Kwakwa by the Hausas; Aku Oyibo by the Igbos; and Agbon by the Yoruba folks.
    </p>

    <h2>Health Benefits of Aya_Creme Drink</h2>
    <p>Aya_Creme is a delicious and nutritious Nigerian gem. The health advantages associated with the consumption of
      tiger nuts, dates and coconut drink are very plenty to discuss
      about. It’s a combo drink with a sweet taste that helps to rejuvenate body and soul.</p>


    <p>In present day Nigeria, Dates with Tigernuts, Ginger and Coconut cream is a wonderful combination drink often
      used for
      aphrodisiac purposes. It is basically a men and women’s drink popular known as Kayan Maza Original or Kayan mata.
      These
      two names actually mean men’s property and women’s property. In addition, the male folks gave it another name as
      Maganin
      Maza na Magida.</p>

    <h2>Rich nutritious goodness</h2>
    <p>Tigernuts are a treasure trove of essential nutrients that your body craves. They are a rich source of vitamins
      C and E, which act as antioxidants, protecting your cells from damage caused by free radicals. They are also
      brimming with minerals like magnesium, potassium, and phosphorus, supporting bone health, muscle function, and
      overall vitality. When you sip on Tiger Nut Drink or Milk, it’s a sip of pure nutrition.</p>

    <p>According to findings, it was discovered that this popular drink is usually used as a sexual drive booster to
      enhance
      performance between a man and his wife. It is also a common treat in some countries in the Middle East, and most
      countries in Africa. Nevertheless, some people often referred to the drink combo as a natural lubricant for the
      female
      folks.</p>

    <!-- <h3>General health Benefits of Aya_Creme</h3> -->
    <ol>

      <h3>
        <li>Rich in nutrients</li>
      </h3>

      <p>Tiger nuts contain a variety of nutrients and beneficial plant compounds.</p>
      <p>Their specific nutrient content depends on the type. There are three main varieties of tiger nuts:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>black</li>
        <li>brown</li>
        <li>yellow</li>
      </ul>
      <p>On average, 1 ounce (28 grams) provides:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Calories: 143</li>
        <li>Fiber: 9 grams</li>
        <li>Carbs: 19 grams
        </li>
        <li>Protein: 1 gram
        </li>
        <li>Fat: 7 grams
        </li>
        <li>Iron: 1–2% of the Daily Value (DV)
        </li>
        <li>Phosphorus: 5–6% of the DV
        </li>
        <li>Vitamin C: 2–8% of the DV
        </li>
        <li>Magnesium: 7% of the DV
        </li>
        <li>Potassium: 3–5% of the DV
        </li>
        <li>Zinc: 5–7% of the DV
        </li>
        <li>Calcium: 1% of the DV
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Tiger nuts are also a rich source of antioxidants, which are beneficial compounds that protect your body
        against aging
        and diseases like <a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/cancer-and-diet">cancer</a> and heart disease.
      </p>
      <p>Research shows that germinating tiger nuts prior to eating them increases their antioxidant content.</p>
      <p>That said, tiger nuts also contain antinutrients, such as phytates, oxalates, saponins, and tannins, which
        can reduce
        nutrient absorption in your gut.
      </p>
      <p>Germinating or roasting the tubers prior to eating reduces their <a
          href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/how-to-reduce-antinutrients">antinutrient</a> levels, making it
        easier for
        your body to
        absorb and use the many nutrients they contain.
      </p>

      <h5>Summary</h5>
      <p>Tiger nuts are tubers rich in fiber, vitamins, minerals, and other beneficial plant compounds. Germinating
        or
        roasting
        tiger nuts prior to eating them can boost their antioxidant levels and improve your body’s ability to absorb
        its
        nutrients.</p>


      <h3>
        <li>May improve digestion</li>
      </h3>
      <p>Say goodbye to constipation and hello to happy digestion! Tiger Nut Drink is packed with <a
          href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/why-is-fiber-good-for-you">fiber</a>, which helps
        keep things
        moving smoothly in your belly. No more drama, just a happy and well-nourished tummy. You’ll feel lighter,
        happier, and
        ready to conquer the world!</p>
      <img src="images/Tiger-nut-pic.jpg" alt="">

      <p>Tiger nuts may promote healthy digestion in various ways.</p>
      <p>For starters, they’re high in insoluble fiber, which passes through your gut without being digested.
        Insoluble fiber
        adds bulk to your stools and helps food move through your gut easily, reducing the likelihood of <a
          href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/foods-that-help-you-poop">constipation</a>.
      </p>
      <p>Tiger nuts are also presumed to contain <a
          href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/resistant-starch-101">resistant starch</a>, a type of fiber that
        can feed the friendly bacteria
        in your
        gut, helping your digestion run smoothly.</p>
      <p>Moreover, tiger nuts may contain enzymes, such as catalases, lipases, and amylases, which help break down
        foods in your
        gut, relieving gas, indigestion, and diarrhea.</p>
      <p>Keep in mind that the high fiber content of tiger nuts may initially cause unpleasant gas or bloating. Those
        interested
        in trying them should increase their portions gradually.</p>
      <h5>Summary</h5>
      <p>Tiger nuts are a good source of insoluble fiber, which can prevent constipation and help your digestion run
        smoothly.
        Add them to your diet gradually to avoid unpleasant gas or bloating.</p>

      <h3>
        <li>May reduce blood sugar levels</li>
      </h3>
      <p>Tiger nuts may help keep your <a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/15-ways-to-lower-blood-sugar">blood
          sugar levels in check.</a></p>
      <p>Animal studies show that tiger nut extract may help reduce blood sugar levels. This may, in large part, be
        due to the
        high fiber content of the tubers, which may slow down the absorption of sugar in the gut.
      </p>
      <p>The protein in tiger nuts also contains a high proportion of the amino acid <a
          href="https://www.healthline.com/health/healthy-high-arginine-foods">arginine,</a> which may increase
        insulin
        production and sensitivity, both of which are important for blood sugar management.</p>
      <p>It should be noted, however, that the amount of arginine used in the cited human study (9 grams) is much
        higher than the
        amount you’ll find in a single serving of tiger nuts, which contains 1 gram of protein.
      </p>
      <p>Moreover, test-tube studies show that tiger nut extract may inhibit the action of carb-digesting enzymes in
        your gut.
      </p>
      <p>As a result, less sugar may be absorbed from your gut in a way similar to the action of some
        blood-sugar-lowering
        diabetic medications. This is thought to potentially <a
          href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/blood-sugar-supplements">lower blood sugar levels,</a> though more
        research in
        humans is needed</p>


      <h5>Summary</h5>
      <p>Tiger nuts are rich in fiber and arginine, both of which can contribute to lower blood sugar levels. They
        also contain
        compounds that may reduce how much sugar is absorbed in your gut after a carb-rich meal.</p>

      <h3>
        <li>May improve heart health</li>
      </h3>
      <p>Tiger nuts may also be good for the health of your heart.</p>
      <p>That’s partly because of the high amount of monounsaturated fats they contain, which give them a fat
        profile similar to
        that of heart-healthy olive oil.</p>
      <p>Diets rich in monounsaturated fats are linked to lower levels of LDL (bad) cholesterol and higher levels of
        HDL (good)
        cholesterol. They are also associated with a lower risk of heart attack, stroke, and death from heart
        disease.</p>
      <p>Research also links tiger nuts to better blood circulation and a lower likelihood of blood clots — both of
        which can
        reduce your risk of heart disease.</p>

      <h5>Summary</h5>
      <p>Tiger nuts are rich in heart-healthy fats. They may improve vein and artery flexibility and blood
        circulation, which may
        reduce your risk of heart disease.</p>

      <h3>
        <li>May boost your immune system and help fight infections</li>
      </h3>
      <p>Tiger nuts may contribute to a stronger immune system.
      </p>
      <p>In one test-tube study, tiger nut extracts were tested against several types of bacteria that can cause an
        infection in
        humans. The extract was effective against <em>E. coli, Staphylococcus, and Salmonella bacteria.</em></p>
      <p>Another cell study found similar results. The researchers added that tiger nut extracts might also be
        effective at
        fighting antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections.</p>
      <p>However, more studies are needed before strong conclusions can be drawn.</p>

      <h3>
        <li>May act as an aphrodisiac</li>
      </h3>
      <p>Tiger nuts have a history of being used to <a
          href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/aphrodisiac-foods">boost libido</a>
      </p>
      <p>They’re used as aphrodisiacs in Ayurvedic medicine. In addition, men in Nigeria have used tiger nuts for
        generations to
        treat erectile dysfunction, increase <a
          href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/boost-male-fertility-sperm-count">sperm count,</a> and boost
        libido.
      </p>
      <p>That said, few studies have investigated these supposed aphrodisiac properties.
      </p>
      <p>One mouse study showed that tiger nuts helped preserve testicular weight and sperm production following heavy
        metal
        poisoning (19).
      </p>
      <p>In a rat study, eating a large number of tiger nuts for 30 days increased testosterone levels, boosted sexual
        activity,
        and reduced intromission time between mating sessions.</p>
      <p>However, there are no studies on using tiger nuts as an aphrodisiac in humans, so more research is needed
        before any
        conclusions can be made.
      </p>

      <blockquote cite="#">
        <h5>Summary</h5>
        <p>Tiger nuts are used as a natural aphrodisiac in some parts of the world. However, human research is needed to
          confirm
          their libido-boosting effects.
